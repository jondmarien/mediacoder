Today marks a massive update for MediaCoder. We've overhauled how you interact with your file queue and introduced powerful client-side capabilities.

## Individual File Mode

We've introduced a new **Single File Mode** to give you granular control over your batch conversions.

- **Toggle Control**: Switch between **Global Mode** (updates apply to everything) and **Single File Mode** (updates apply to selection).
- **Smart Forking**: Editing a specific file "forks" its settings from the global defaults, preserving its unique configuration while other files continue to inherit global updates.
- **Visual Cues**: The queue list now clearly indicates which file is being edited, with dedicated highlight states.

## Intelligent Background Removal

Seamlessly remove backgrounds from images directly in your browser using the power of the **IMG.LY SDK**.

- **Privacy First**: Processing happens locally on your device; no images are sent to a server for background removal.
- **Auto & Manual Modes**: Choose between one-click SDK removal or legacy manual color-based transparency.
- **Smart Validation**: Automatically detects unsupported formats (like GIFs) and warns you before processing.

## UX Enhancements

It's the little things that make the difference.

- **Eyedropper Tool**: Added a precision color picker for manual background removal—click anywhere on your image to sample the color.
- **Dynamic Queue**: File names in the list now dynamically update to show their target extension (e.g., `image.webp`).
- **Download as Zip**: You can now download a zip archive of your converted files as soon as **2 or more** are ready (previously required 3).
- **Funny Loading Messages**: Processing large files? Enjoy our new rotating loading status messages (Reticulating splines...).
- **Success Confetti**: A little celebration when your batch is done. 🎉
- **Changelog Page**: Added this very page you're reading! Track the project's history in style.

### Fixes & Polish

- **State Sync**: Fixed an issue where changing settings in Single File Mode could visually desync the queue list for other files.
- **Hero Update**: Refreshed the main page hero text.
- **Cross-Origin Isolation**: Enabled COOP/COEP headers to support high-performance client-side operations.
